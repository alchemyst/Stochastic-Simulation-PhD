	abstract = {A hierarchical and object-oriented dynamic modeling and simulation system called ForeSee has been developed, which demonstrates some of the key aspects of four sets of modeling components to represent the dynamic modeling and simulation of chemical processes. These fundamental modeling components can be categorized into four types (containments, core models, connectors, and coordinators), each of which describes a different aspect of system behavior. It is in the representation of equipment models that ForeSee differs most strongly from all the other simulation systems. In these systems an equipment model consists of a set equations and the associated codes for their execution. In ForeSee an equipment model is specified as an interconnected set of modeling components. The basic premise in this approach to modeling is that a relatively small set of modeling components can be used to generate a variety of equipment models, and in turn a lot of higher level models of complex processes can be assembled from the equipment models.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a model of an industrial chemical process for the purpose of developing, studying and evaluating process control technology. This process is well suited for a wide variety of studies including both plant-wide control and multivariable control problems. It consists of a reactor/ separator/recycle arrangement involving two simultaneous gas--liquid exothermic reactions of the following form: A(g) + C(g) + D(g) --> G(liq), Product 1, A(g) + C(g) + E(g) --> H(liq), Product 2. Two additional byproduct reactions also occur. The process has 12 valves available for manipulation and 41 measurements available for monitoring or control. The process equipment, operating objectives, process control objectives and process disturbances are described. A set of FORTRAN subroutines which simulate the process are available upon request. The chemical process model presented here is a challenging problem for a wide variety of process control technology studies. Even though this process has only a few unit operations, it is much more complex than it appears on first examination. We hope that this problem will be useful in the development of the process control field. We are also interested in hearing about applications of the problem.},

	abstract = {Both researchers and industrial engineers interested in Manufacturing Scheduling and Control (MSC) are frustrated by the complexity of the problem and the wide range of approaches that have been proposed. The research environment often discourages scientists from the extensive effort and hands-on experience needed to gain a realistic view of the problem, and manufacturing engineers have no way to assess the relative practical value of the many proposed approaches. This white paper proposes a Manufacturing Scheduling and Control Testbed (MASCOT) to address these challenges to technology transfer: a Virtual (simulated) Factory, supporting a library of detailed industrial cases. Researchers can use MASCOT as a convenient source of realistic challenges, and vendors and manufacturers can use it to identify promising technologies for more rapid transfer to commercial application. In addition to this primary mission, the MASCOT Virtual Factory will provide several key technical elements in support of the broader vision of agile manufacturing enterprises. 1.

	abstract = {A formal methodology capable of transforming time-records of process variables into meaningful and explicit descriptions of process trends in real-time is presented in this paper. The representation is based on the formal definition of "temporal episodes," which provide descriptions of trends by constructing "histories of episodes" making explicitly all the important "domain landmark values" specified by the user as well as the "geometric landmark values" generic to trends. Model inaccuracies are confined by establishing specific measures of information lost in the descriptions and keeping them below those of the process models. Despite the simplicity of the representation primitives, it is shown that the representation can provide complete, correct, robust and very compact models for process trend histories. In contrast to pure qualitative descriptions, the new representation contains sufficient quantitative information to allow for powerful inferences of the trends of the unmeasure variables.},

Representational paradigms and simulation techniques are presented. Integration is achieved by constructing a hierarchical suite of abstractions and simulation services built on a common microkernel. The abstractions and services are encapsulated into composable software components that leverage emerging distributed component platform technology, such as JavaBeans or Common Object Request Broker Architecture objects, for interoperation. Following the trend in large software system development, composable abstractions and services enables the use of interoperable components to assemble simulation applications from a variety of services and models, potentially from different vendors. The results illustrate a unified modeling and simulation strategy spanning low level logical/functional unit to high level architectural/process system design. New efficiencies in design methodologies are promoted by consolidating disparate simulation environments and models. Examples are given concerning performance simulation of microelectrofluidic systems.},

We desire an algorithm that enlists every degree d polynomial h such that h(xi)-yi[less-than-or-equals, slant][delta] foratleast [rho] fractionoftheindices i.If [delta]=0, this is just the list decoding problem that has been popular in complexity theory and for which Sudan gave a poly(m,d) time algorithm. However, for [delta]>0, the problem as stated becomes ill-posed and one needs a careful reformulation (see the Introduction). We prove a few basic results about this (reformulated) problem. We show that the problem has no polynomial-time algorithm (our counterexample works for [rho]=0.5). This is shown by exhibiting an instance of the problem where the number of solutions is as large as exp(d0.5-[var epsilon]) and every pair of solutions is far from each other in l[infinity] norm. On the algorithmic side, we give a rigorous analysis of a brute force algorithm that runs in exponential time. Also, in surprising contrast to our lowerbound, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for learning the polynomials assuming the data is generated using a mixture model in which the mixing weights are "nondegenerate."},

	abstract = {Octave and Python are open source alternatives to MATLAB, which is widely used by the High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) community. These languages are two well known examples of high-level scripting languages that promise to increase productivity without compromising performance on HPC systems. In this paper, we report our work and experience with these two non-traditional programming languages at the HPCMP Centers. We used a representative sample of SIP codes for the study, with special emphasis given to the understanding of issues such as portability, degree of complexity, productivity and suitability of Octave and Python to address signal/image processing (SIP) problems on the HPCMP HPC platforms. We implemented a relatively simple two-dimensional (2D) FFT and a more complex image enhancement algorithm in Octave and Python and benchmarked these SIP codes on several HPCMP platforms, paying special attention to usability, productivity and performance aspects. Moreover, we performed a thorough benchmark containing important low level SIP core functions and algorithms and compared the outcome with the corresponding results for MATLAB. We found that the capabilities of these languages are comparable to MATLAB and they are powerful enough to efficiently implement complex SIP algorithms. Productivity and performance results for each language vary depending on the specific task and the availability of high level functions in each system to address such tasks. Therefore, the choice of the best language to use in a particular instance will strongly depend upon the specifics of the SIP application that needs to be addressed. We concluded that Octave and Python look like promising tools that may provide an alternative to MATLAB without compromising performance and productivity. Their syntax and functionality are similar enough to MATLAB to present a very shallow learning curve for experienced MATLAB users},

In this paper, we present a PSO algorithm, extended from discrete PSO, for flowshop scheduling. In the proposed algorithm, the particle and the velocity are redefined, and an efficient approach is developed to move a particle to the new sequence. To verify the proposed PSO algorithm, comparisons with a continuous PSO algorithm and two genetic algorithms are made. Computational results show that the proposed PSO algorithm is very competitive. Furthermore, we incorporate a local search scheme into the proposed algorithm, called PSO-LS. Computational results show that the local search can be really guided by PSO in our approach. Also, PSO-LS performs well in flowshop scheduling with total flow time criterion, but it requires more computation times.},

@article{citeulike:1418372,
	abstract = {This paper describes an interaction analysis method for a general multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system based on its fuzzy rule-based model. Most real-world multivariable systems are nonlinear, complex and time varying. The multiple system input-output variables interact and sometime even fight against each other, causing significant challenges for system control and optimization. Especially in many practical applications, the accurate quantitative system model is not available or difficult to obtain, which subsequently makes it impossible to analyze the system multivariable interaction characteristics. In this paper, the nonlinear MIMO system is first modeled by fuzzy basis function networks (FBFN) based on a set of linguistic IF-THEN rules or data. The multivariable interaction property is analyzed locally around the operating point based on the relative gain Array (RGA), which is systematically formulated using the system steady-state gain values. Two simulation examples of chemical distillation columns illustrate the system interaction degree obtained by the proposed method is in a sufficient accuracy compared with the result calculated from the system explicit mathematical model, which indicates the applicability of the proposed method as an alternative way to derive the system multivariable interaction when the system mathematical model is not available.},

	abstract = {A controller design procedure for MIMO systems with explicit plant uncertainties is suggested. In the proposed method, the closed loop analysis is integrated in the controller synthesis by an outer optimization loop that optimizes the low frequency performance of the closed loop system subject to additional performance and robustness criteria constrained by specifications. Modifications of the specifications then clearly shows the trade off between performance and robustness in different frequency regions. The controller synthesis is based on PID weighted ?? loop shaping where the structured singular value (?) is used in the optimization to guarantee that the performance specifications are met in spite of the uncertainties. The optimization problems are costly, non-convex and ill-conditioned and we use a combination of new global and standard local optimization algorithms available in the TOMLAB optimization environment to solve the problem. The method, which does not rely on a good initial guess and converges robustly in finite time, is applied to a 2 × 2 model of a distillation column and the example shows how a slight modification of specifications on the sensitivity function and control activity may give large improvements in the load disturbance rejection.},

	abstract = {It is suggested that modern controller design packages often fall short of offering what is truly practical: lower order controllers, discrete-time controllers operating in a sampled-data loop, and finite word length (FWL) realizations of controllers with the FWL property minimally impacting closed-loop performance. Several methods for achieving these objectives are considered. The methods deal with controller complexity, transfer function matching, stability robustness, signal spectrum matching, fractional representations of open-loop unstable controllers, discrete time controllers, and realizing digital controllers},
