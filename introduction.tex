\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

Chemical engineering process modelling and simulation poses a
significant challenge to the computer program developer.  Chemical
processes are invariably described by nonlinear equations such as
chemical reaction kinetics, flow-pressure relationships and physical
properties.  Dynamic simulation such systems involves the solution of
sets of nonlinear differential and algebraic equations.  There is also
uncertainty associated with the model equations themselves (model
uncertainty), their parameters (parametric uncertainty) and the inputs
into the model (input uncertainty).

This work aims to present a framework for the development of
stochastic dynamic simulations of chemical processes.  The framework
is designed to be generic.  The large problem of stochastic dynamic
simulation has been broken down into three steps: input modelling,
process modelling and postprocessing.  

This document is divided into three sections

Each step of the simulation is
discussed
