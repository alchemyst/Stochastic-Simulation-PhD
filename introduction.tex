\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}

\section{Motivation}
Chemical engineering process modelling and simulation pose a
significant challenge to the computer program developer.  Chemical
processes are invariably described by nonlinear differential equations
such as chemical reaction kinetics, flow-pressure relationships and
physical properties.  Dynamic simulation of such systems involves the
solution of sets of nonlinear differential and algebraic equations.
There is also uncertainty associated with the model equations
themselves (model uncertainty), their parameters (parametric
uncertainty) and the inputs into the model (input uncertainty).

This work aims to present a framework for the development of
stochastic dynamic simulations of chemical processes. The framework is
designed to be generic. The large problem of stochastic dynamic
modelling has been broken down into three steps: input modelling,
process modelling and postprocessing.

\section{Structure of the document}
This document is divided into three sections: 
\begin{description}
\item[Part I] reviews relevant literature pertaining to statistics,
  dynamic simulation of chemical engineering systems and existing
  frameworks for these activities.
\item[Part II], Part II explains the implementation details of 
\end{description}

\section{Contributions}
The deliverables of this work are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A novel application of multi-objective optimisation to the identification of transition probabilities in Markov Chain models of input sequences.
\item A set of Modelica models that enable modelling of chemical engineering unit operations
\item Support for using CAPE-Open compliant property databases for the calculation of thermodynamic properties in these models
\item A set of programs that can run models built using this framework in Monte Carlo simulations
\end{enumerate}
