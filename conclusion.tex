\section{Conclusion}

\section{Recommendations for further research}
\subsection{Input characterisation}
One problem with the PSO based algorithm proposed here is that it does not handle an arbitrary number of events smoothly.  Most optimisation algorithms treat the design space as a single metric space, with each design having the same number of design variables.  An interesting method of moving beyond this approach is Genetic Programming.  Some work has been done in this regard \citehere.  Development of a Genetic Programming based algorithm for Multiobjective optimisation of the piecewise curve fitting problem is recommended.  Particularly, the concept of Symbolic Regression should be addressed.
